## Budgeting

The OWG has submitted a [proposed 2021 (Q2-Q2) budget](/2021/02/23/budget.html) to the board. Work is underway at estimating 2022 and 2023 spending.

## Planet

The minutely replication diffs have switched from being produced by Osmosis to being produced by osmdbt. This required a maintenance window, but was intended to have no user-visible changes to replication.

Some software including osmupdate stopped working because it required a specific comment line to be present. The comment has been re-added, and there is now official [documentation of the state.txt format](https://github.com/openstreetmap/osmdbt/blob/master/man/osmdbt-state.txt.md).

## Wiki

The OWG has decided that all requests for the sysadmins to install a new wiki extension should be made by wiki admins.

For any extension requests, the sysadmins will have to consider the cost of maintaining it, and have a strong bias to only enable modules that ship with mediawiki itself.

## Featured

CyclOSM has been added to the featured layer list on the OpenStreetMap website.
