# 2017-10-12 outage due to expired SSL certificate

Due to a bug in the deployment process for new SSL certificates and another bug in the status monitoring for certificates nearing expiry, there was a 15 minute period during which the site wasn't accessible. Between 7:11pm and 7:26pm the main site served an expired SSL certificate. See [#176](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/176).
