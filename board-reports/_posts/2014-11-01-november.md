# Chef repo mirroring

We are now mirroring the public chef repository to github
at [https://github.com/openstreetmap/chef](https://github.com/openstreetmap/chef). We 
hope this will encourage more interest in the configuration
and perhaps more contributions from outside OWG.

# Ramoth RAID rebuild

At around 18:30 on Friday 21st November the slave database server, ramoth, was taken offline
while the main RAID array was converted from RAID10 to RAID6 in order to increase the available
space. It was bought back into service around 18:30 the next day.

# UCL power outage

On 24th November we were notified of a scheduled power outage at UCL for the following
weekend of 29th/30th November. Taginfo was moved temporarily to one of the US servers
and Nominatim to a server kindly provided by Simon Poole.
