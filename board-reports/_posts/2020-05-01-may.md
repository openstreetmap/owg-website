## Git

The [network issues between UCL and Github](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/381) were diagnosed as a faulty UCL firewall and fixed.

## API

The new database servers, [snap-01](https://hardware.openstreetmap.org/servers/snap-01.openstreetmap.org/) and [snap-02](https://hardware.openstreetmap.org/servers/snap-02.openstreetmap.org/) have been racked and connected.

## Standard tile layer

Tile servers are upgraded to OpenStreetMap Carto 5.2.0.

New tile caches were set up. [Falkor](https://hardware.openstreetmap.org/servers/falkor.openstreetmap.org/), hosted by Vodafone in Prague, Czech Republic and [Shruikan](https://hardware.openstreetmap.org/servers/shruikan.openstreetmap.org/), hosted by [greenminihost](https://www.greenminihost.com/) in Dronten, Netherlands.

## Hardware

4 1U servers were removed from UCL for disposal.

Several failed or failing disks were replaced in machines.

Two servers to replace stormfly-01 and stormfly-02 have been installed at OSUOSL. One is planned to be a tile cache.

## General

Some services have been upgraded to Ubuntu 20.04.

## New featured layers

We have approved [Ã–PNVKarte](http://xn--pnvkarte-m4a.de/) as a new featured layer on OpenStreetMap.org. More [submissions for featured layers](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/new-tile-layers/) are welcome and will be evaluated when they come in.
