## Operations Meetings

The OWG has been holding fortnightly meetings with interested people working on specific operations-related topics. This allows people to help without the time committment of joining the OWG. If this interests you, you can contact us by email.

## Tile Service

The OWG has switched all tile traffic to Fastly. If you proxy requests to tile.openstreetmap.org, [you must ensure you set the Host header to "tile.openstreetmap.org and set a User-Agent to correctly identify who you are](https://twitter.com/OSM_Tech/status/1343976097067782145). We are considering what to do with the old cache servers, and if some of them can be repurposed. We will begin contacting people shortly.

The current [tile logs](https://planet.openstreetmap.org/tile_logs/) will not be using the correct data until we [figure out new log analysis options](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/485).

## Development server

The OWG is considering what to do with errol, the dev server. The current hardware is dated, and a lot of stuff running on it is unmaintained.
