# Outage 2nd February

Around 01:30 GMT on 2nd February the slave database server, ramoth, became unresponsive, leading to a partial outage of the web site and API that was resolved around 07:00 GMT when the server was power cycled.

# Planet file missing

The 2015-02-09 planet did not generate as usual. The issue was
investigated and determined to be due to a race condition. The code
[was
fixed](https://github.com/zerebubuth/planet-dump-ng/commit/d3fdedd13784976ca970868e2ab08c41ad6bc9de)
and a new version was released. The 2015-02-16 planet appears to have
generated normally.

# Reduction of power usage at UCL

Due to construction work at UCL, the servers are in a temporary home
with reduced access to power and cooling. In order to reduce the power
load and increase resilience to site failure, we moved a bunch of
stuff around.

## Taginfo server

The taginfo server (grindtooth) was shut down and its functions moved
to a server in the US (stormfly-01). ([ticket](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/22))

## Nominatim server

There were two Nominatim servers (pummelzacken, poldi) at UCL, which
isn't a great situation for resilience to site failures. One of them
(poldi) was moved to IC so that a service can be maintained even when
one site is down. ([ticket](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/20))

## Upgrade munin server hardware

The munin server (urmel) was pulling about 300W on old hardware. The
disks were swapped into a newer chassis and the power draw dropped by
approximately half. ([ticket](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/21))

# OOB access to wiki server

The wiki server (ouroboros) had been [upgraded](/2014/10/31/october.html)
back in October 2014, which meant the OOB port's MAC address had
changed and was inaccessible. The new MAC address on record has been
updated. ([ticket](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/16))

# Render machine SSD upgrade

The rendering machine at IC (orm) had been getting close to full on
its 512GB SSD. This was replaced with a 1TB
SSD. ([ticket](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/6))

# SSL certficates

New certificates were purchased and deployed, but had to be rolled back
due to incompatibilities with JOSM's use of the Oracle JVM certicate list.
