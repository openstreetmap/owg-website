New tile caches were set up. [Vipertooth](https://hardware.openstreetmap.org/servers/vipertooth.openstreetmap.org/), hosted by Ukrainian Telecommunication Group in Kiev, Ukraine and[Tuatara](https://hardware.openstreetmap.org/servers/tuatara.openstreetmap.org/), hosted by [HostedIn.NZ](https://hostedin.nz/) in Wellington, New Zealand.

The process for replacing [orm](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/283) and [HP DL360 G6 machines in Amsterdam](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/282) has begun. These machines are at the end of their useful lifetime.

The OWG has formalized the [service classification policy](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/classification/) that it has been using, classifying services as primary, secondary, or tertiary.
