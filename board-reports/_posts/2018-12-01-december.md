# Hardware

Grant went to Amsterdam and replaced failing disks in [ironbelly](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/245), [orm](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/250), and upgraded disks in [ouroboros](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/246).

Additional network redundancy was added in Amsterdam with a [RPS2300](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/254), allowing redundant power for the switches.

The failed motherboard in ramoth was replaced.

# Planning

Quotes were obtained for [additional storage, network, and remote hands](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/231) in Amsterdam.
