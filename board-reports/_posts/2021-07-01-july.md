## Standard Tile Layer

IP-based rate limiting has been implemented for the standard tile layer. Requests are automatically denied in cases of persistent abuse. 0.001% of users were causing 13% of backend load, and 0.1% of QGIS users were causing 38% of QGIS load.

We've resumed publishing lists of standard tile layer tile requests at https://planet.openstreetmap.org/tile_logs/. The lists have how many times a tile was requested, provided it was requested from at least 3 IPs and a total of at least 10 times.

## Github

2FA is being [required on the OpenStreetMap Github organisation](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/540).

## 2022 planning

The OWG has a [2022 planning document](/2021/07/22/plan.html) looking at where we anticipate requesting money in 2022.

## Trac

Trac has been shut down and [replaced with an archive](https://github.com/openstreetmap/trac-tickets/issues).
