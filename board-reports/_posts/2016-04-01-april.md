# IC Electrical Testing

The primary site, where both the primary and replica databases are, informed us that they were going to perform electrical testing in one of the two rooms in May.

Initially, we thought we'd only have to [move a database to a different room](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/67). However, due to all of our networking being in a single room, it was not possible to keep anything at IC available over the weekend.

# New database server purchase

A new database server, [karm](https://hardware.openstreetmap.org/servers/karm.openstreetmap.org/) was purchased. This is OSM's first all-solid-state server, and should provide both faster API and website access and fewer maintenance issues.

# Disks failed in Ramoth

[Two disks failed](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/60) in the replica database server. Spares were ordered, as the disks were old enough to not be under warranty, and replaced.
