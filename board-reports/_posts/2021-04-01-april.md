## Monitoring

The OWG continues to experiment with long-term storage of metrics for Prometheus.

## OAuth2
A [testing instance](https://oauth2.apis.dev.openstreetmap.org/) has been set up for [OAuth2](https://github.com/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website/pull/3177)

## Standard tile layer
The OpenStreetMap Carto stylesheet has been updated to v5.3.1.

The OWG is looking at placing a rendering server with the Umea Academic Computing Club.

## Planet distribution
Torrent files are now available for the planet files. They are automatically created and use webseed to distribute the load among the mirrors.

## OTRS
The OWG is [looking for alternatives to OTRS 6](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/518) as new versions of OTRS are no longer open source.

## Dublin

The OWG has selected Equinix DB4 as the location for the new Dublin site.

## Discourse

A [server](https://hardware.openstreetmap.org/servers/lockheed.openstreetmap.org/) has been allocated for testing Discourse requirements, but is waiting on admin time for install.
