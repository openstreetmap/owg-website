## Dublin

### Networking

The networking at DB4 will be two Juniper EX4300 switches. We have decided not to do BGP at this time because it is not worth it for our network size.

### Physical

DB4 requires advance provisioning of a patch panel, which was not disclosed to us in advance. Sorting out the patch panel size and cost added a delay and took significant time.

## Hardware

Seven used HP DL360 Gen9 servers have been ordered for Dublin. They will have non-HP branded drives.

All new supermicro servers in the 2021 budget have been ordered. Some were scheduled for 2021Q4 and 2022Q1 but were ordered sooner because limited component supply means the lead time could be up to 12 weeks.

## Standard Layer

Two new rendering servers have been ordered. One is being installed in Dublin, the other in Umeå, Sweden.

There will be a [presentation on usage of the OpenStreetMap Standard Layer](https://2021.stateofthemap.org/sessions/GGLYCK/) at SOTM 2021.

### June 8th outage

The Standard Layer was impacted by the [June 8th Fastly outage](https://www.fastly.com/blog/summary-of-june-8-outage), along with much of the internet.

## Geocoding

A new nominatim server has been ordered for Dublin.

## Planet

Two new planet servers have been ordered, one for Amsterdam and another for Dublin

## API

A new API database server has been ordered for Dublin
