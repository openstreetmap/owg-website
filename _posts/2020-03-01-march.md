# irc.openstreetmap.org

The CGI:IRC page has been upgraded to redirect to the official OFTC webchat IRC. You can continue to use irc.openstreetmap.org, use https://webchat.oftc.net/, or use your choice of IRC client.

# tile.openstreetmap.org

A number of default user-agents and heavy use apps have had their access to tile.openstreetmap.org restricted. If you are developing software using the OSMF tile servers, be sure to follow the [tile usage policy](/policies/tiles/).

# API

[OSM JSON](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_JSON) format is now available in production. Supported endpoints are listed on the [OSM API 0.6](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/API_v0.6#JSON_Format) wiki page.

Four additional API 0.6 endpoints are now being directed to CGImap.

# Upgrade of cgimap

cgimap was upgraded from 0.7.5 to version 0.8.1. JSON output is enabled by default now.

See [release notes](https://github.com/zerebubuth/openstreetmap-cgimap/releases) for a list of all new features/bug fixes.

# Policies

The OWG has approved a new [banner policy](/policies/banner/) for event banners on OpenStreetMap.org.
