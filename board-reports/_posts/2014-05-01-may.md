# Enabled SPDY Protocol on Tile caches

On May 28th enabled the [SPDY protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPDY) on all OpenStreetMap Tile Caches (CDN) to improve map tile load latency.

# Updated SSL certificates

The openstreetmap and tile certificates were replaced with new certificates using 2048 bit keys and SHA256 checksums.

# Facebook and MS Live authentication

Authentication using Facebook and MS Live was enabled for the main site.
