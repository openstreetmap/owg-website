# Failed hot-spare in DB machine

This appeared to have failed, and was racking up [a lot of "other" errors](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/49#issuecomment-143414304). It was [swapped out](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/49#issuecomment-144948083) and the new disk appears to be okay.

# New aerial imagery machine

Installed one of the new aerial imagery machines, [grisu](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Servers/grisu), at IC.

# DB index corruption

Due to a hard power-off, there was some database corruption affecting indexes to the way nodes of [way 336972780](http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/336972780). Rebuilding the way nodes for that way solved the problem without downtime. (Note that, even if the problem had been more severe, no data would have been lost had we had to restore that data from a backup.)
