# Tiles

The OSMF-owned tile server Orm has been replaced by [Odin](https://hardware.openstreetmap.org/servers/odin.openstreetmap.org/), a new server with significantly more capacity.

# Hardware

The four HP DL360 Gen9 machines at Amsterdam were put in use for three front-end servers and a wiki server.
