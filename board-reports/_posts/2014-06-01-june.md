# New nominatim server

The second nominatim server (pummelzacken) has been installed at UCL and is being tested.

# Retirement of Brisbane tile cache

The hardware running bunyip, our tile cache server based in Brisbane, Australia has stopped working, and the sponsor is no longer able to fix it. We thank them for providing the tile cache and are looking for alternative tile cache sponsors  in Oceania.

# Preparation for move of UCL machines

Matt and Grant have inspected the facilities being offered by UCL at Wates House while Wolfson House is being refurbished and have been making the necessary arrangements with UCL. One machine (ascalon) has been moved as a test.
