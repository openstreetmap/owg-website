## Budget

The board has approved the OWG budget at the "high" option suggested in Feburary. The [approved budget is available](/2021/03/26/budget.html).

## Hardware

A power supply failed and tripped one of the breakers at Amsterdam. This had no impact on the services because the other side power remained running. A dashboard for power was [added to prometheus](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/512).

## Data Center

The OWG is researching options for a site in Dublin, Ireland.

## Monitoring

The OWG is exploring the use of TimescaleDB and Promscale for long-term prometheus metric storage and would welcome input from anyone with experience at medium or larger deployments of it.
