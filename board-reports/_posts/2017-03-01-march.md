# Fixed GPX upload emails

The GPX upload server process was not sending emails when the upload was complete. This was an unintended side-effect of converting the GPX service into a "systemd unit", which meant that it was not allowed to run the program which sends mail. See issue [#153](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/153).
