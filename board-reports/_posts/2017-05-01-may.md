# Switch to statuscake

All uptime monitoring, including automatic failover for tile caches and render servers was switch from [pingdom](pingdom.com) to [StatusCake](statuscake.com).

# Greek tile cache

A new tile cache, hosted by [GRNET](https://grnet.gr/en/) in Athens, was added to the tile CDN.

# New database slave

A new database server, [eddie](https://hardware.openstreetmap.org/servers/eddie.openstreetmap.org/), a twin for [karm](https://hardware.openstreetmap.org/servers/karm.openstreetmap.org/) was delivered, racked up and installed ready for being bought up as database mirror.
