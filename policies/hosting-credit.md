# {{ page.title }}

OWG has adopted the following policy for giving credit to supporters who donate hardware or hosting to OSMF. OWG will:

1. Credit everyone on [https://hardware.openstreetmap.org/thanks](https://hardware.openstreetmap.org/thanks) and link to that page from [http://osm.org/about](http://osm.org/about)
2. Credit the top 3 donors by equvalent Â£/yr value on the [front page](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) (currently, UCL, Bytemark and IC), as "Hosting supported by \<donor direct links>, and others \<link to hardware.osm.org/thanks>."
3. Try to publicise new supporters who are donating hardware of hosting from time to time via blog posts, tweets and other publicity channels.
