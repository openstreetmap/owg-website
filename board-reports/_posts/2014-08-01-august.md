# Notes Dump

We now produce a dump containing all of the OSM Notes. It is updated daily and is available at [planet.openstreetmap.org/notes/](http://planet.openstreetmap.org/notes/)

# Pummelzacken

We've been experiencing problems with disks being kicked out of the RAID array on Pummelzacken (future nominatim server). We're working with our hardware supplier to find the root cause.

# Yevaud

One of yevaud's disk arrays has been degraded for several weeks due to a failed disk. A warranty replacement has been arranged and should be installed in early September. The increased load on the server led to delays in deploying new openstreetmap-carto stylesheets.

# Ubuntu 14.04

Ubuntu 14.04.1 has now been released, so 14.04 is now available as an LTS update and we have started upgrading our machines.
