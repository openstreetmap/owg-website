# Reload of nominatim

The nominatim geocoder database was reloaded.

# Tile server reload and upgrade

All four tile rendering servers were upgraded to openstreetmap-carto 4.0.0 which required a
reload of the rendering database on each machine using the hstore based style. The rendering
databases were upgraded to Postgres 9.6 at the same time.
