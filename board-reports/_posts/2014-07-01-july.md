There was a power outage at our Imperial hosting shortly after 9am BST on the 2nd July. Power was restored almost immediately, but both database servers had to be manually reset and ironbelly had to check it's main filesystem. Normal service was largely restored by 11am BST but GPX traces remained unavailable until the file system checks on ironbelly were completed around 2pm BST.
