# Add SOTM chooser repository to Github

The page allowing people to choose which SOTM site to visit was only hosted on OSM's internal git server. Now it is hosted on Github as well, which makes it more discoverable and easier to submit PRs against. See [#186](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/186).
