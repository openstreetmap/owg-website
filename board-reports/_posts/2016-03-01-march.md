# SSL Certificates

bastik noted that the latest versions of JOSM [support custom certificate authorities](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/55#issuecomment-199208093), and later [Oracle accepted a letsencrypt cross-signed certificate](https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/will-the-cross-root-cover-trust-by-the-default-list-in-the-jdk-jre/134/44). So it's looking good for an upgrade next year. See [issue 55](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/55) for more details.
