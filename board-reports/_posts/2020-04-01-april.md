# Standard Tile Layer

A number of default user-agents and heavy use apps have had their access to tile.openstreetmap.org restricted. If you are developing software using the OSMF tile servers, be sure to follow the [tile usage policy](/policies/tiles/).

Tile servers are being upgraded to OpenStreetMap Carto 5.1.0.

## New tile caches

New tile caches were set up.
