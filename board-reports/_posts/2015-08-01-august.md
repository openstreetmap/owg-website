# Reporting Security Issues

We've set up a new email address security@openstreetmap.org for reporting any security issues that aren't suitable for public bug trackers.

# Network driver issues

A reboot exposed [some network driver issues](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/45) on pummelzacken. After some investigation, it was found that the upgrade to the 3.16.0-47 kernel appeared to be responsible. This was confirmed when downgrading fixed the issue. Chef [was](https://github.com/openstreetmap/chef/commit/d1be18e9426db54d3cf367855ee95fd8ed117e3b) [updated](https://github.com/openstreetmap/chef/commit/1df3edbee59a60ca0bd7005124c12e99205fd2d1) to pin the kernel to this version to prevent further issues, although at some point we'll have to test a newer kernel version to get back on the mainline.

# Failing disk replacements

Disks failed in [yevaud](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/44), a tile server, and [katla](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/43), the main DB server, and were replaced under warranty.

# Restart Taginfo server

Grindtooth, which had been a taginfo server, but [was shut down to conserve power](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/22) was restarted. Due to a mix-up it was also wiped clean, but that's why we've got Chef. It is a candidate for moving to a new site, generously sponsored by [Exonetric](http://www.exonetric.com/).

# Backfill planets

A couple of planet files, 2015-07-06 & 2015-06-29, had failed to generate [due to sofware errors](https://github.com/zerebubuth/planet-dump-ng/commit/7b6abce122fe7839532ab9a8d71282201d21efef). After that bug had been fixed, the missing planet files were regenerated.

# SATA issues continue

In the on-going Saga of the Cables, [the cables were swapped out again](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/42#issuecomment-135032689) in poldi. Unfortunately, [the errors continue](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/42#issuecomment-135182040). The current thinking is that the SATA backplane is to blame.

# Getting rid of old hardware

The 3 old web / API backend machines were replaced last month were still worth something, so rather than being scrapped, were [put up for sale](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/osmf-talk/2015-August/003367.html).
