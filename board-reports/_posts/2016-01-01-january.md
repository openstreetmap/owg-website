# Parasoid API / Kiwix offline support

The Parasoid API is enabled on the OSM wiki to support [Kiwix](http://www.kiwix.org/wiki/Main_Page) offline. [Ticket](https://trac.openstreetmap.org/ticket/5355).

# Dulcy - new Nominatim server

We were able to resolve that the performance issues with postgresql were due to a bad shared_memory setting. After reducing shared_memory to 2GB the throughput is now more than sufficient to serve Nominatim traffic.

Dulcy was moved in production as the main Nominatim server on the 22nd.

# Belarusian tile cache

Thanks to [Komяpa](http://www.openstreetmap.org/user/Kom%D1%8Fpa), we have a new tile cache in Belarus; [Cmok (Цмок)](https://hardware.openstreetmap.org/servers/cmok.openstreetmap.org/). 

# New hardware list

An automatically updated list of OSMF [hardware](https://hardware.openstreetmap.org/) is now available, updated [based on information from Chef](https://github.com/gravitystorm/osmf-server-info).
